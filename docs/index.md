### What is PSense?

PSense is a system that evaluates sensitivity of probabilist programs. It takes programs written in the source language of [PSI](http://psisolver.org) as input and automatically evaluates how the noise in the prior distributions affects the posterior probabilities solved by PSI. PSense measures the posterior change via statistical distances including expectation distance, Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, total variation distance, and Kullback–Leibler divergence.
